Example repository used for the talk Characterisation tests, the answer to the "I don't know what this does" question.

The talk can be found in [Codurance's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@codurance_spain) where I was following these [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_XSvyilDpNTusSZWdJ7prK2CCOLQ76bx7X-Joo7vHUw/edit#slide=id.g2b4290f1793_0_101). The exercise and the slides are based on an example by [Michael Feathers](https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/bio) that you [can read here](https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/characterization-testing). 

I'm sure that if you invest few minutes to check the code in [Main](src/main/java/Main.java) you will understand what is ding very quick.

But the main goal of this exercise is to **use the Characterisation testing** strategy to extract information from the code, instead of reading it. 

You can follow the different [tests written here](src/test/java) to understand what is happening and to use them as base examples for the next ones I encourage you to write. 

Any suggestion to improve the code or the tests is more than welcome.
